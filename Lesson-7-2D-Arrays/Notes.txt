Arrays can be of fixed size or variable size (only in C++11 and after), but has to have a size.

1D Array:

Initialize an array (if it isn't, each value will be some junk value):
	- a[] = {value1, value2, value3}
	- a[] {value1, value2, value3}

Set: a[i] = [some value or variable];
Get: [some variable] = a[i];

For loops are often used with arrays (Loops have iterators which can represent the array index). This is also why loops are often started at 0 - the first index of an array is 0.

Declaring an array: array_type array_name[array_length];

2D Array:

Declaring a 2D array: arr_type arr_name[rownum][colnum];
Getting a value: arr_name[row_index][col_index]

Initialize using {}: if you have jimmy[2][3], it might look like this:
{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};
Initialize using nested loop:
for (int i = 0; i < rownum; i++) {
	for (int j = 0; j < colnum; j++) {
		jimmy[i][j] = [some value];
	}
}
